# Crop Recommendation System
ABSTRACT

The project is “CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM”. This is an automatic crop prediction system based on weather and soil data.

       	India is an agricultural country, and its economy predominantly depends on agriculture yield growth and allied agro-industry products. In India, agriculture is largely influenced by rainwater which is highly unpredictable. Agriculture growth also depends on diverse soil parameters, namely Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Soil moisture, Surface temperature, and also on weather aspects which include temperature, rainfall, etc. This technology proves that it is beneficial to agriculture which will increase crop productivity resulting in better yields for the farmer. Weather forecast data such as temperature and rainfall and soil parameters repository gives insight into which crops are suitable to be cultivated in a particular area. The proposed system will integrate the data obtained from soil parameters, the weather department and by applying machine learning algorithms a prediction of the most suitable crops according to current environmental conditions is made. This provides a farmer can identify the values of parameters for a particular crop. This provides variety of options of crops that can be cultivated. Thus, the project develops a system by integrating data from various sources, data analytic and prediction analysis which can improve crop yield productivity and increase the profit margins of farmers.
